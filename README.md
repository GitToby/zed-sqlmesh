# zed-sqlmesh

Language support for SQL and [SQLMesh](https://sqlmesh.readthedocs.io) in [Zed](https://github.com/zed-industries/zed).

You'll need `sqlmesh_lsp`, a command from installing the sqlmesh package, installed and on your PATH:

- active .venv with the `sqlmesh[lsp]` extra installed
- installed with `uv tool install sqlmesh[lsp]`

Check with `which sqlmesh_lsp`.

Please open an issue if you encounter them - help is welcome as I really have no idea how LSPs work.
